**DC High voltage measurement PCB**
This project was created during my time at [Team Karting Manipal Electric](https://www.instagram.com/teamkartingmanipal/) and served the purpose of getting the HV battery voltage to the LV side in an isolated way to measure and store in a data acquisition system. This project utilizes an Isolated amplifier IC and and LDO for power. This PCB was designed for a 14S-24P Li-ion battery pack.
